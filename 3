<p> Another hobby of mine is golf, I love golf because it is great to get outdoors and play in the beautiful weather with your buddies. It is a very competitive game 
with yourself as well as it helps me with hockey because of the mental aspect of it. My favorite clubs are: </p> 
<ol>
  <li>Driver</li>
  <br>
  <li>Putter</li>
  <br>
  <li>9 iron</li>
</ol>

<p> My favorite proffesional golfer is Collin Morikawa, I love his swing and the way he approaches the game, he also has sick style on the course. He is 
a very young promising golfer so he has a lot of work to do but has already one two majors and champion golfer of the year. </p> 
<p> I started to take golf lessons this summer because I really want to up my game this coming summer and become a legitimate golfer with a low single 
digit handicap. </p>

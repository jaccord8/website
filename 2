<p> My favorite animal is a Tiger, they are the largest cats in the wordl that can weigh up to 363kg, which is massive. 
They are carnivores so they only eat meat, no plants or fruits if they ever were to find any in the wild. </p> 
<p> There prey are mainly larger animals such as deer, wild pigs, antelope and buffalo, they usually hunt solo at nigh time 
hunting there prey slowly and carefully. </p> 
<p> They are also unreal swimmers and love to cool off during hot summer months in either pools or streams. 
They are also very fast too, being so large they can reach speeds up to 65km/h which is impressiver for how heacy these animals are. </p>
